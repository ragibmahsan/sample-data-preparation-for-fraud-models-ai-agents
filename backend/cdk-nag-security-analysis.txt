NOTICES         (What's this? https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/wiki/CLI-Notices)

34892	CDK CLI will collect telemetry data on command usage starting at version 2.1100.0 (unless opted out)

	Overview: We do not collect customer content and we anonymize the
	          telemetry we do collect. See the attached issue for more
	          information on what data is collected, why, and how to
	          opt-out. Telemetry will NOT be collected for any CDK CLI
	          version prior to version 2.1100.0 - regardless of
	          opt-in/out. You can also preview the telemetry we will start
	          collecting by logging it to a local file, by adding
	          `--unstable=telemetry --telemetry-file=my/local/file` to any
	          `cdk` command.

	Affected versions: cli: ^2.0.0

	More information at: https://github.com/aws/aws-cdk/issues/34892


34635	Support for this Node.js version will end soon

	Overview: Support for Node.js v18.20.8 ends on November 30,
	          2025. Please upgrade to a recent LTS version.

	Affected versions: node: >=18.0.0 <20.0.0
